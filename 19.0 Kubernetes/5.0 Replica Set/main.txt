This ensures that the number of desired pods are running in the nodes. It works like autoscaling group.

replica set

    kubectl create -f rs-definition.yaml

    kubectl get replicaset

    kubectl get pods

    kubectl delete replicaset name

    kubectl describe rs name

    Note:
        Replica set ensures the label is used to choose the ones you need

        if you change something in the manifest file

        kubectl replace -f rs-definition.yaml



    If you create a replica set and delete one of the pods, immediately another pod will be  created to replace it.

    If you create a pod without using the replica set, and you use the pod definition file with the same label, it deletes it immediately.


    To scale the number of pods:

        kubectl edit replicaset name

        It opens in vim and you end the configuration.

     Better way:
        kubectl scale rs name --replicas=number_of_desired
