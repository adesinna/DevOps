Sometimes we need to pass commands and arguments to our pods in k8

In docker:

    docker build -t printer:v3 .

    Run

    docker run printer:v3 # it will use the argument in the CMD

    docker run printer:v3 shanana # it will overwrite the argument


use the com.yaml definition file

kubectl logs container_name # this will show the things it executed
