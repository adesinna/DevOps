Configuration settings
When you want to change defaults, we use configuration file

Priority:
ANSIBLE_CONFIG(environment variable set)

ansible.cfg(in the current directory)

~/.ansible.cfg(the hidden file in home directory)

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Go to the documentation and check the settings for each configuration

Creating your own configuration file:

ansible.cfg

now you can execute play book

ansible-playbook name_of_yaml
