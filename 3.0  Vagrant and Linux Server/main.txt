vagrant global-status # this will check the status of all the vms on the system

vagrant global-status --prune # this will prune all dead vms

vagrant init "box_name" # so you can get all the settings needed


Private IP:
    ipconfig getifaddr en0 # wireless
    ipconfig getifaddr en1 # ethernet

    if config # for fedora


Public IP:
    curl ifconfig.me



Note # do not comment by the side in vagrantfile

For Ubuntu:
    apt install net-tools
    ifconfig # this will show your ip add



Vagrant Sync Directory:
    Any file you put in the directory where the vagrant file is, it will copy it into the vm at location
    /vagrant/. If you create anything in the vm in /vagrant, it will appear in the host vm.
    chmod 777 script


    Customising Your Sync Directory:
    Go to the line, and replace ../data with the absolute path
            # To sync folder and give your customise one, the last path is where you want it to be in the vm
            config.vm.synced_folder "/Users/user/desktop/devops/3.0  Vagrant and Linux Server/myshellscript", "/opt/myshellscript"

           then reload vm for it to take effect.


Provisioning VM:
    This will excute some commands while starting up the vm

         config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
         yum install httpd wget unzip -y  #start
         mkdir /opt/shinaops
         free -m
         uptime                          #end
       SHELL




    If the vm already exist use

        vagrant reload --provision



    Use ifconfig # apt install net-tools

    Use eth1 or eth2 to access it!


Setting Up Web Servers:

    Manually:
        Fedora:
            Set public and private ip

            login

            yum install httpd wget unzip -y

            systemctl start httpd

            systemctl enable httpd

            ip addr show # to see address

            sudo lsof -i :80 # to check if port 80 is working

            To make it accessible without firewall blocking connection:
                sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
                sudo firewall-cmd --reload

            Sever Data:
                It is always located in the var directory

                cd /var/www/html

                Put a html file in there

            Putting WEB file in the server:
                download the link to the zip file in tmp
