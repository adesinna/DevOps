Getting Started With Git

- How to create a repository locally

    git init

    git status # check the status of the file

- You can also do the same thing by creating it online and clone it

    git clone github_link # this only works like this for a public repo

- How to clone private repo

Get your token
    Settings > Developer setting > Personal Access Token

    Generate Token

    git  clone https://token@github.com/rest_of_the_link



git init:
    This is used to initialize the local repo.

        git init # this should be done inside the repo.



git status:
    This is will tell you the status of files in your repo. Whether it is staged or unstaged

          git status



git add:
    This command takes all the file to the staging area.

        git add filename

        git add . # adds all unstaged file

git commit:
    This will commit all the staged files to the git repo.

        git commit -m 'commit message'


Note:
When you work on your laptop it is called the working directory
When you add, it means it puts them in an imaginary area called staging area
When you commit, it means you put it in imaginary local repo
i.e Earth(PWD) Heaven-Gate(Staging) Heaven(local repo)


git log:
    This will give you the history of the pass commits

        git log

git show:
    This will give you the full details of the commit. The changes made.

        git show commit_id # the first 7 character would do




git remote:
    This is used to link a local repo to a remote repo

        git remote add origin link

        git remote -v # this show the linked repo

        git remote add upstream link # other project that is not yours but you have access to
