Bash script is used to provision server and vms

scriptbox.vm.synced_folder "./data", '/vagrant_data' # this will sync the folders

use echo to print these variables
Variables:
    To declare a variable:

        varname=value

    To call a variable:

        $varname # this is to call the variable


Arguments:
    $0 # this will display the script

    $1-9 # this is the other arguments attached to the script

    ./4_arguments.sh shanana is 9.5 meter tall
       0                1     2  3    4     5

System Variables:
    $0 - the name of the script
    $1-9 - the first 9 arguments
    $# - How many arguments were passed to the bash script
    $@ - all the arguments supplied to the bash script
    $? - The exit status of the
    $$ - process id of the current script
    $USER - This shows the user running the script
    $HOSTNAME - The hostname of the machine running the script
    $SECONDS - The number of seconds since the script started
    $RANDOM - Returns a random number
    $LINENO - Returns the current line number in the bash script

Quotes:
    Single quotes doesnt prevent preserve special character, so always use double quotes
    if you want it to escape the special character you will use \$
        NAME="Adesina"
        echo "My name is $NAME and I want to be worth a billion dollar \$\$\$"

Command Substitution:
    free -m | grep -i mem | awk '{print $4}' # get free memory, find mem, use awk to print column 4
    To store this, we use:
        MEMO=$(free -m | grep -i mem | awk '{print $4}')

Exporting Variable:
    If you declare a variable on the shell, it is said to be on the parent shell
    if you write a script and call the variable inside the script, it would not execute
    because the parent shell doesnt share the variable in the child shell.
    To make it global:
        export VAR_NAME

    To make it permanent for user:
        go to the home of the user
        cd ~
        vim .bashrc
        export VAR_NAME=VALUE

    To make it permanent for all user:
        vim /etc/profile
        export VAR_NAME=VALUE

User Input:
    To collect user input:
        read var_name

    For prompt:
        read -p 'Username: ' USR # the variable name will USR as prompt
        read -sp 'Password: ' pass # the password will be hidden

Conditional Statement:
    if statement:
        if [ condition ] # the space is mandatory
        then
            commands
        fi


    if else:
        if [ condition ] # the space is mandatory
        then
            commands
        elif
        then
            commands
        else
            commands
        fi



loops:
    for loop:

        for var in item1 item2 ... itemn # val will store each item
        do
            command
        done


        for i in {0..10..2} # just like range(0,10,2) in python
        do
            echo $i
        done

        example:
            #!/bin/bash

            for i in {1..5}
            do
                    echo $i
                    ((i=i+1)) # the increment has (())
            done



    while loop:
        #!/bin/bash

        counter=0

        while [ $counter -le 5 ]
        do
                echo $counter
                ((counter=counter+1))
        done
