 When developers write codes there are best practices that needs to be followed.
Code analysis would fix all errors and vulnerabilities that are in the code
It just improves the code quality.
Sonarqube does this.


Code Analysis:

    This is a kind of test that will be conducted on the code, it is different from software testing.

    It will flag the Vulnerabilities, check for bugs.


    We are going CheckStyle and Sonarqube


    Go to Tools:

        Add Sonarqube Scanner

            Name: sonar4.7
            version: 4.7.0.2747

    Go to configure system to integrate with jenkins

        Go to SonarQube servers

            tick the environment variables

            name: sonar # make sure it is sonar

            server_url: http://private_ip # of the sonarqube

            Then save it

            Now to sonarqube page click on my account> administration > security > generate tokens

            Go back to Configure system > Sonarqube server

            Click on add dropdown and select jenkins

            Kind: secret text

            id: MySonarToken # use it for description too


    Check the code analysis jenkins and create a new job using it # this will use only checkstyle analysis


Now we would use the sonar test jenkins code to do the code analysis with sonarqube
