When a code is being developed it cycle goes like this
                4. push

    1.code                  3. test locally


               2. build


Developers keep merging code to a VCS several times a day. All the code to collected from different developers would have
generated conflicts and bugs. Code merged from a long time when built would throw conflicts, bugs and error.

All these would need to be resolved, which takes a very long time and halts development.

Jenkins is one popular tool for continuous integration.



Installing Jenkins on Ubuntu:

    - Get an Ec2 instance
        Allow access for ssh at port 22

        allow access to port 8080 for jenkins


    - provisioning


        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk

        # go to jenkins webiste and run it as a script

        curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
          /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
        echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
          https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
          /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install jenkins -y

         # to see the commands you have executed

         curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data # to see this provisioning script


    - login on online
        access port 8080

        cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword # this is the password


    Install git plugins

    - create a jenkins user and save this url http://107.23.165.68:8080/


Jobs in Jenkins:
    Job is just work load which jenkins will do for you, just like shell scripting in linux.

    Freestyle Jobs: They are all graphical jobs

    Pipeline As A Code: This is a script written in groovy



Configuring the tools Jenkins will use

    - Go dashboard > manage Jenkins > tools

    - JDK (Unclick Automatic)
        sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y  # do this inside the instance

        NAME: OracleJDK8
        JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64


    - MAVEN
        NAME: MAVEN3

        version: just pick the latest
