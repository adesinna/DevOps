Pipeline as a code:

    This is a way of setting up a pipeline automatically in a file called Jenkinsfile, this file can either be put in
    the source code or can be written as a job in jenkins.

    This file defines the stages in the CI/CD stages

    We are going to use declarative way of writing the Jenkinsfile

    Concepts:
        Pipeline: The main block of code and everything outside will be executed by jenkins

        Node/Agent: They are settings and, you can define the node where the pipeline will be executed

        Stage: This where the actual execution happens

        Steps: these are the commands


            pipeline {

                agent{
                    this is where the job is going to run
                }

                tools {
                    this the tools you want to use like jdk
                }

                environment {
                    this is where you put the environment variable
                }

                stages {
                    The steps will be here
                }
            }

    Example
         pipeline {
            agent {
                label "master"
            }

            tools {
                maven "Maven"
            }
         }







    Hint tools have "" and others have ''

    Use java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64 for this pipeline

    Every build has its own workspace


### So when setting up security groups
### In nexus-sg allow access of jenkins sg from 8081
### In sonar-sg allow access of jenkins-sg from 80 # since we used nginx in sonarqube
