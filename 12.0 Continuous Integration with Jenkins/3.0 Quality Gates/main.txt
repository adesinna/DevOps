Quality Gates gives conditions to the codes based on some metrics

- Go to sonarqube server > Quality Gates

-Create Quality Gates, vprofile-QG

- Add conditions, bugs

- set the upper limit to 60 # it means fail the build if the bugs are more than 60

- go to project on sonarqube

- click on the project and go to the settings and select the quality gate you created

- To send the information to jenkins, we are going to use webhooks in the project settings

    create webhook
        name: jenkins-ci-webhook

        url: http://private_ip:8080/sonarqube-webhook

- Use the jenkins file in Quality gate to build
