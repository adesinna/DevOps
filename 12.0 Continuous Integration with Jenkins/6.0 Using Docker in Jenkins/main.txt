Step 1:
    Install Docker Engine on the Jenkins server

#!/bin/bash

# Update the apt package index
sudo apt-get update

# Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common -y

# Add Docker's official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the Docker repository to APT sources
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

# Update the apt package index again
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker Engine
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y

# Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running a test container
sudo docker run hello-world

Step 2:
    There is an automatic jenkins user

        id jenkins


    Add it to docker group

        usermod -a -G docker jenkins

Step 3:
    AWS CLI should be installed

        apt install awscli -y

    reboot the jenkins instance

        reboot

Step 4:
    Go to AWS > IAM > Users

    create user named jenkins and get access key

    Give it EC2Registry and ECS permission

Step 5:
    Go to Elastic Container Registry Service

    Make it private and name it vprofileappimg

    Create

Step  6:

    Go to plugins in jenkins and install

        Docker Pipeline

        Amazon ECR

        Amazon Web Services SDK

        CloudBees Docker Build and Publish

Step 7:
    We need to store the AWS Credentials on Jenkins

        Go to manage credentials

        Go global and add credentials of the AWS access key

            id: awscreds
            description: awscreds

Step 8:
    registryCredential = 'ecr:us-east-1:awscreds'
    appRegistry = "728821484712.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/vprofileappimg"
    vprofileRegistry = "https://728821484712.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"

    Run the Jenkins file


Step 9:
    ECS is like container hosting platform

        Go to AWS ECS and create cluster
            name: vprofile

            turn on use container insight

        Now go to task definitions

            create new task named vprofileapptask

            Name: vproapp

            uri: 728821484712.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/vprofileappimg

            port should be 8080

            Memory: 2GB is okay


        Now go back to cluster and click on service


            click on create

                family: vprofileapptask
                Revision: Latest
                service name: vprofileappsvc

                Load Balancer
                    create a new one
                    name: vprofileapplbecs
                    port: 80
                    targetgroupname: vproapptg
                    protocol: HTTP
                    health check path: /login

                Networking

                    create new sg

                    name & description: vprofileapplbecs-sg
                    choose HTTP as protocol allowing source from anywhere

                click on  # wait for a while till the service get created

Step 10:
    Go to Ec2 service

    Go to target groups > Health check
        edit the port to 8080
        Healthy threshold: 2

    Go and update the sg of the ecs to allow port 8080 from any ipv4 or ipv6 #wait for sometime

    go to task and access it from public ip at 8080

    Actually use the load balancer to access it # it is in the networking
