All logs are always generated when someone visits your website, however this takes so much space in storage. So it is
always advisable to archive your logs and clear them.

To see the logs on the instance:
    cd /var/log/httpd

    cat the log files

Create a web instance using the web.sh

Create S3 Bucket
    name: logs
    select the same region as the instance


Archive the log files

    tar czvf logs.tar.gz *

Create a directory in tmp and move it there

cat /dev/null > access_log
cat /dev/null > error_log

We use aws cli to move it

yum install awscli

Go to IAM account and create a use with access key and secret key

Now go to the terminal


aws s3 ls # list all the buckets


aws s3 sync /tmp/logs s3://bucket_name
