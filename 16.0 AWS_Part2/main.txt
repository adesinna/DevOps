Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- it is a logical data center within an aws Region and you will have your own control

IPv4 Address:
    It is a 32 bits binary number

     0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 # this is the entire ip range

   public ip: for the internet
   private ip: for within the network


Subnet Masks:
    By using subnetting, network administrators can create smaller, more manageable networks,
    which can improve network performance and security. Additionally,
    subnetting allows for better allocation of IP addresses, which can be important in large networks
    where IP address exhaustion is a concern.



    Private IP:
        ipconfig getifaddr en0 # wireless
        ipconfig getifaddr en1 # ethernet

        if config # for fedora


    Public IP:
        curl ifconfig.me

    ifconfig # to see all


    255.255.255.0

    This means that 1 - 254 will be assigned in the network

    172.16.12.0 # network ip
    ... # usable

    172.16.12.255 # broadcast ip

    subnets divide em
     172.16.12.1 - 172.16.12.10 # first subnets


CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing:

    255.255.255.0 / 24  # 8*3 each 255 is an 8


VPC creates two types of subnets and where the ec2 instances will go are determined by the router

It goes to Internet Gateway for the VPC Subnet Public

IT goes to NAT Gateway
