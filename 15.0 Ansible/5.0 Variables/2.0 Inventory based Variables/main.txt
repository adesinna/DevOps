Inventory based variables

We can create  variables which all the host in the inventory file can use

create a directory called group_vars

    create all file # this file contains

playbook variables comes before group_vars

You can create another file for group_vars
It must be a group name in the inventory file

playbook_vars > group_vars/host_vars > group_vars/group name >  group_vars > group_var/all
