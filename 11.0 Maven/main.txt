Build Process:
    In general, build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code
    When developers write a code for an application it is code a source code,
    next they would compile the code with a compile-language like java , and
    they would test it, if it works they would package it into an archive.

    source code ===> compile ===> Test ===> Packaging ===> Health checks

    Maven will automate the build process, do all these automatically. Maven is a java build tool

    Maven ====== Java
    Ant  ====== Java  # maven > ant
    Make ===== RPM, Debian
    Gradle == Groovy
    Ansible === Python



    Build tool is always based on the programming language.


    Build with maven on ubuntu:

        sudo apt install git -y

        git clone https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-repo.git

        git checkout vp-rem

        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

        java -version

        apt-get install maven -y

        mvn -version # make it is the same java version

        mvn test # this will run the test phase and download the dependencies  and output in target file

        mvn install # the artifact in the target directory with extension war

        mvn clean # clear all the output in the target directory and the artifact

        mvn clean install # cleans but regenerate the output directory
