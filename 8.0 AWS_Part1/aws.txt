AWS is a cloud provider, it can be used for quite a lot of things from security to databases.


EC2 Service:
    It is known as Elastic Compute Cloud. They provide web services API for provision, managing and provisioning
    virtual servers inside amazon cloud.

    You can easily scale up or scale down many features



    Creating EC2 instance:
        - Select North Virginia Region
        - Go to services and select Ec2
        - Go to Ec2 dashboard
        - Go to instance and launch instance
        - Give it a name and tag #tags are used for filtering
        - Go to AMI(Amazon Machine Image) and select the appropriate Virtual Machine
        - A lot in browse more AMIs, especially the marketplace
        - Choose the one you want
        - Instance type is the requirement of the system
        - Create new key-pair for login, it will download the key as pem.
        - Go to network settings and rename the security group name and give it a description
        - You can provision the server at user data info under the advance details
        - The click on launch instance

    Connecting Instances:
        - Click on connect
        - Click on SSH client
        - go to where the pem file is on terminal
            chmod 400 name.pem
        - copy and connect using number 4 example

    Accessing Ports:
        To access port 80 or any other port, apart from the default 22

        - click on instance id and go to security
        - click on security groups id
        - Edit inbound rule and allow port 80 or any port you want
        - http://34.239.249.210/ # the ip is the public ipv4



Hosting a website using EC2:   # best practices
    - Gather the requirements needed:
        * os
        * size of RAM, CPU, Network and Storage
        * Type of Project
        * The type of application that will be running
        * Environment (development or production)


    - Key pairs:
        Create a key pair using the name of the project and download it.

    - Create Security Group:
        One security group can be use for multiple instances
        SSH Rule

    - Launch Instance:
        Create instance name with Resource types instance, volumes and network interfaces
        Pick the AMI you need
        Select the instance type
        Select the Key Pair login using the one you created for this
        click on instance id and go to security
        click on security groups id

    - Go to advance info:
        provision in user data

    - launch your instance

    -  Connecting Instances:
        - Click on connect
        - Click on SSH client
        - go to where the pem file is on terminal
            chmod 400 name.pem
        - copy and connect using number 4 example

     - Accessing Ports:
        To access port 80 or any other port, apart from the default 22


        - Edit inbound rule and allow port 80 or any port you want
        - http://34.239.249.210/ # the ip is the public ipv4


When you stop your instance, the public ip address will change when you start it again.
You can make it a static public ip, elastic ips are used.

Elast IP:
    Go to elastic IPs and click allocate
    Next associate it will the instance

        aws ec2 describe-instances

    You can use chat GPT to do anything on cli




    EBS (Elastic Block Storage):

        This is a virtual hard disk for your ec2 instances which is called volumes.
        EBS also provide a service called snapshot which is the virtual backup of the volume.
        Make sure the instance and the EBS volume are in the same zone.

        Types of EBS Volume:
            - General Purpose(SSD) # most workload
            - Provisioned IOPS # large database
            - Throughput Optimized HD # Big Data and Data Warehouses
            - Cold HDD # file servers
            - Magnetic # backups and archives


        When an instance is created a volume is always attached, you can see this in the storage session of
        the instance.

        Suppose that you want to add extra volume, to the instance where we want to keep web images

        How to create a volume:
            - Go to Volumes
            - Click on create volume
            - Get a general purpose volume # The total must be less than 30G
            - Choose the same zone as the instance
            - Make sure you tag it # Name: Extra-Volume
            - Click on action in the volume session
            - Attach the Volume and Make sure you select the instance you created the volume for.
            - Now login to the instance on the command line and host a static website
            - cd /var/www/html # the aim is to put all the images in a storage

            -Partition in EBS Volumes:
                A disk partition is a logical section or division of a physical hard drive or EBS volume. Disk
                partitioning involves dividing the available storage space on a disk into one or more partitions,
                each of which can be formatted with a file system and used to store data.

                With EBS volumes in Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can create partitions when you create a new EBS
                volume or when you attach an existing EBS volume to an EC2 instance. By partitioning an EBS volume,
                you can organize your data and optimize disk usage.

                For example, you might create multiple partitions on an EBS volume to store different types of data,
                such as application data, log files, and backups. Or you might use partitions to separate your operating
                system files from your application data, which can help you manage updates and backups more effectively.

                It's worth noting that partitioning can also affect performance, as it can impact the way data is read
                and written to the disk. Therefore, it's important to consider your specific use case and workload requirements
                when deciding whether and how to partition your EBS volumes.

            - fdisk -l:
                This shows you the hard disk storage and the partition that is attached to it.

                Disk /dev/xvda has a partition of /dev/xvda1


            - df -h:
                This shows what part of the system is mounted on each partition.

                /dev/root       7.6G  2.0G  5.6G  27% /   # this means everything in root is mounted on that disk


            - Creating a partition:

                * fdisk /dev/xvdf  # this is the part of the attached volume and it is gotten from fdisk -l command

                * click m for help and read the manual

                * click n to add new partition

                * click p for primary partition

                * Give it partition number, 1 which is the default. You have 1-4

                * first sector, just hit enter

                * last sector, hit enter to create the entire disk partion there or +1G to +5G for the one of your choice

                * hit p to print the partition you just made

                * hit w to save the partition

                * fdisk -l # this will show the partition


            - Mounting on the Partition:

                * mkfs + tab*2 # hit tab twice

                * We are using the extension 4

                * mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1  # the partition format

                * create directory /tmp/img-backups

                * mv img/* /tmp/img-backups

                Temporary Mount:
                    mount /dev/xvdf1 /var/www/html/img

                    umount /var/www/html/img # this will unmount the directory

                Permanent Mount:
                    vim /etc/fstab

                    Append:
                        /dev/xvdf1  /var/www/html/img ext4 defaults 0 0

                    mount -a # to mount all in fstab file

                    mv /tmp/img-backups /var/www/html/img # check it and selinux to disable

                    systemctl restart apache2
