Understanding the project

       - Nignx is a web service that provides the load balance, and routes request to the apache Tomcat
         which is a java web application service.

       - The tomcat  will have a storage like NFS

       - Rabbit MQ is acting as a dummy service to enable the project to be a little complex

       - Memcache service will connect to the SQl service, but it is a cache for it so when the tomcat connects
         it won't need to access the sql all the time apart from the first time

       - The login details the user access through the Tomcat will be stored in mysql service
